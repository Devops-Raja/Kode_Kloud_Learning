GIT BRANCH:

- Create a new branch from Master & Make changes
- Merge the new branch with master branch ( Switch to master branch and Merge)
- Push the both branches to origin
- git push origin master && git push origin newbranch

GIT Remote REPO - Explanation

You’re working with Git repositories that exist locally and also as bare remotes (servers).
/opt/cluster.git
→ This acts like your central Git server.

A working clone of it at
/usr/src/kodekloudrepos/cluster
→ This is the local working directory where you edit files, commit, etc.


What is a remote repo in Git?
A remote is simply a shortcut name that points to another Git repository (often on a server).
Example:
git remote add origin /opt/cluster.git

This means:
Your local repo in /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/cluster knows that there’s another repo (remote) at /opt/cluster.git.
When you run git push origin master, your commits are sent to that repo.
----------------------------------------------------------
Adding remote REPO--->

“Add a new remote dev_cluster and point it to /opt/xfusioncorp_cluster.git.”

That means:

You already have your main repo /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/cluster

You now add a second remote connection (besides origin)

This new remote (dev_cluster) points to a different bare repository at /opt/xfusioncorp_cluster.git

Command:
git remote add dev_cluster /opt/xfusioncorp_cluster.git

Now, your working repo can push changes to either:

The original remote (origin) → /opt/cluster.git
Or the new one (dev_cluster) → /opt/xfusioncorp_cluster.git

Why do this?
This is common in multi-environment or multi-server setups:
origin might be the main production repo.
dev_cluster might be a development or test copy.
You can push updates to both places, depending on what you’re deploying or testing.
So instead of keeping two separate working directories, you can have:One repo (/usr/src/kodekloudrepos/cluster)

Two remotes pointing to different bare repos on the storage server.
