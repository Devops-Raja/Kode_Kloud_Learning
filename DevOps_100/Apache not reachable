APACHE SERVICE IS DOWN IN THE APP SERVER && NOT ABLE TO CONNECT FROM THE JUMPHOST


Issue & Solution:  on APP server
-- Checked the journal logs etc
-- httpd is configured to listen on 8084 But, port is already occupied by another sendmail service.
## netstat -tulpn | grep 8084 (list output)
-- httpd should listen on 8084, So stopped the sendmail service
Then restarted the service, It works Fine.


Issue: Cant reach the httpd server from Remote

Analysis Done: checked the traceroute " traceroute host:port "
It shows the connection is refused to the app server.
FW is not installed and active
Cause: IP tables are blocking the port

Solution: Used iptables to explicitly allow TCP traffic on that port.
[root@stapp01 ~]# sudo iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport 8084 -j ACCEPT
[root@stapp01 ~]# iptables-save
