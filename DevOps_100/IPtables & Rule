INSTALLING IPTABLES AND CONFIGURE RULE TO ALLOW TRAFIC FROM SPECIFIC PORT AND HOST

sudo yum install iptables-services -y
	
sudo systemctl start iptables && sudo systemctl enable iptables

## Explicit IP Rule for allowing trafic from specific port & host 

iptables -I INPUT 1 -p tcp --dport <PORT_NUMBER> -s <IP_ADDRESS> -j ACCEPT

## All TCP traffic to port will be blocked unless a previous rule explicitly allows it.

iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport <PORT_NUMBER> -j DROP

## Save the rules to load the rules automatically after reboot
service iptables save

## Checking the rules are still there even after reboot
systemctl restart iptables

## Rules show
sudo iptables -nvL

Note:
Case: firewalld was not installed on this server.
"dnf install firewalld" failed because DNS/mirror issues prevented downloading packages.
--iptables comes pre-installed on all Linux systems, so it works without extra packages.
--iptables gives direct, low-level control, so you can allow/block ports immediately.
