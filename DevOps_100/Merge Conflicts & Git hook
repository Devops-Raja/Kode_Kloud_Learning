Merge Conflict?

A merge conflict happens when Git can’t automatically decide
which changes to keep from two different branches.

When two people edit the same part of a file differently, Git needs your help.


EG:

Max users working on master branch and story.txt file
Sara user worked and already pushed on master branch story.txt file

now Max user - editing in the story.txt file and trying to push on master - Conflict Occurs

Now Max pulling the origin repo ( git pull origin master)
Then Max opens the story.txt file, removes conflict markers, keeps correct content,

Then git add . / git commit / git push origin master



Note: Git conflict need to be reviewed and Fixed

GIT HOOKS:
A Git hook is a script that Git runs automatically when certain events happen in a repository — like:
before you commit,after you push,before merging, etc.

cd your-repo/.git/hooks  ( Inside bare repo we have many hook files under the hook folder)
pre-commit  --- 	Before a commit is made	Check code style, run tests, lint
commit-msg	---     After writing commit message	Validate message format
pre-push	---     Before pushing to remote	Run tests or checks
post-commit  etc...


We can edit our hook file according to our requirement

In our case : we need to create post-update hook for Everytime change in the Master branch-
it needs to create a release tag with date .

cd to your bare repo .git/hooks/
Edit the hooks as per requirement.

Script : Referred from Internet

Then-- Switch to your local repo and make changes and Push the Master. Then fetch locally as below
git fetch --tags
git tag

you should see the results of your hooks (eg : release 14-10-2025 )
