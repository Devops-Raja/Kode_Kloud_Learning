=============================Reverse Proxy==========================================

Definition:
A reverse proxy is a server that sits in front of one or more backend servers and forwards client requests to them.

Key Points:

The client never talks directly to the backend server.

The reverse proxy receives the request, forwards it to a backend server, gets the response, and sends it back to the client.


=========================LOAD balancer ============================================
A load balancer is a system that distributes incoming requests among multiple backend servers to balance the load.

Key Points:

Improves performance and availability.

Common algorithms:

Round-robin → evenly cycles through servers.

Least connections → sends to server with fewest active connections.

IP hash / sticky session → same client always goes to the same server.

Can be combined with reverse proxy functionality.

✅ In Your Setup

Nginx is both a reverse proxy and a load balancer.

Clients never directly contact the Apache servers.

Apache servers (httpd) generate the actual web pages.

Load balancing ensures no single Apache server is overloaded.
