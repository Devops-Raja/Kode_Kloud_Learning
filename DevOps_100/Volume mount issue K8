Resolve Volume Mount issue in K8:
"nginx-phpfpm" Pods have two containers ( nginx-container & phpfpm container )

-- Kubectl describe configmap <configmap_name>
configmap is mounted with " root /var/www/html "

Get the yaml file -->   kubectl get pod nginx-phpfpm -o yaml  > /tmp/nginx.yaml
now edit the yaml file, as below

replace this "/usr/share/nginx/html" with "/var/www/html" in nginx  mount path places in that yaml

Then delete the old pod [ kubectl delete pod <pod_name>

--> kubectl apply -f new_yaml.yml

Copy the index file into nginx root location
--> kubectl cp  /home/thor/index.php  nginx-phpfpm:/var/www/html -c nginx-container

validate by curl  
--> kubectl exec -it nginx-phpfpm -c nginx-container  -- curl -I  http://localhost:8099
