Docker Network:

What is Macvlan:
macvlan lets each container appear on the same physical LAN as the host, 
with its own MAC and IP address.
Itâ€™s used when you want containers to behave like separate physical devices on your local network.

CMD:  docker network create -d macvlan --subnet=192.168.0.0/24 --ip-range=192.168.0.0/24 media

Notes:
-d driver : macvlan 
subnet range & IP range (Restricts Docker to use only a specific range within that subnet)
media -- Network name

Verify :
docker network ls
docker network inspect network_name
