SE Linux Installation and Configuration:

SELinux (Security-Enhanced Linux) is a mandatory access control (MAC) system built into Linux (mostly Red Hat / CentOS / Fedora).

It adds an extra layer of security on top of traditional file permissions (rwx) — 
controlling which processes can access which files, ports, or devices, even if file permissions would normally allow it.

--> sudo dnf install selinux-policy selinux-policy-targeted policycoreutils

(If you disable SELinux, it means it’s completely turned off — the kernel doesn’t even load the SELinux module at boot)

If you dont want to apply the SElinux polices then do below,

sudo nano /etc/selinux/config
change it to ---->   SELINUX=disabled

Now after reboot


Install SELinux packags	-- You have the tools and policy files available
Set SELINUX=disabled	-- The SELinux system won’t run or enforce any rules
Result =	The OS behaves like a system without SELinux — only normal Unix permissions apply
