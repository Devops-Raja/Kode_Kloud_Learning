Maria DB Trouble shooting:

App is unable to connect with the DB.
Seems Maria DB service is down.

Unable to start service:

Do: 
-- Check jounrnalctl logs
-- Check var/lib/mysql logs
-- This case --> Mysql is not able to communicate with the directory
2025-10-09  8:30:00 0 [ERROR] InnoDB: Operating system error number 13 in a file operation.
2025-10-09  8:30:00 0 [ERROR] InnoDB: The error means mysqld does not have the access rights to the directory.

Solution:
drwxr-xr-x 1 root mysql 4096 Oct  9 08:21 mysql
/var/lib/mysql  - Permission changed 
                - Ownership changed
				
				
Start the Mariadb service. (Work done !!!)
